!!! WARNING
    This page is out of date and written in the present tense.
    In March of 2024 I left Turn 10 Studios to join Riot Games which I have not
    created a page for yet.

(#) Turn 10

*December 2021 â€” March 2024*

I work at Turn 10 studios leading ForzaTech's security and technology sharing
teams. ForzaTech is the engine behind Forza Motorsport, Forza Horizon and Fable.

Turn 10 and Playground Games are the two sibling studios under the leadership
of Alan Hartman. Our studios have a history of collaboration with a shared
engine lineage that has diverged over time while developing multiple AAA games
concurrently. The tech share team exists to remove obstacles between technology
team to improve architecture alignment, code alignment and access to resources.

ForzaTech's security team acts as a conduit for security knowledge and 
technology. We are responsible for anti-cheat, anti-piracy and have shared
responsibilities in the domains of player safety and privacy.

I initially joined Turn 10 as a senior engineer on the Tech Share team and
currently work as tech share's dev lead and manager, the security team's dev
lead and manager, and as an IC.

(#) Halo Studios

At 343 Industries (now: Halo Studios) I had quite an interesting start. I
ramped up right as covid-19 was sending us all home, the hiring manager that
brought me on had left the company while I was in the immigration process, and
the gameplay team had substantially changed it's mission statement multiple
times from when I was interviewed to when I started.

My role was to support the gameplay engineering team which was primarily there
to support game designers. This allowed me to lean on my game engine and systems
development experience to get my hands dirty on deep debugging, fixing
architecture issues with gameplay systems and reviving old previously-working
systems such as co-op.

I also spent a fair bit of time working on loan to the systems team doing engine
programming work, mostly to fix bugs and diagnose tricky crashes.

Although I got to work on some very interesting problems, this gameplay team was
not a particularly good fit for me. On December 8th 2021, the launch date of
Halo Infinite: I transferred to Turn 10 Studios to work on ForzaTech's tech
share team.

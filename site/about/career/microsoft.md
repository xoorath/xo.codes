(#) Turn 10

*December 2021 â€” March 2024*

At Turn 10 Studios I held the title of Senior Software Engineering Manager and
acted as tech lead and principal IC of the ForzaTech security and technology
sharing teams.

I was responsible for the anti-cheat, anti-piracy and game security intelligence
strategy and implementation on Forza Motorsport. I had also provided leadership
in these domains while collaborating with Playground Games on Forza Horizon 5
and Fable.

The technology sharing team I led consisted of deeply technical engineers
working with an R&D mindset to innovate on new ways for Turn 10 and Playground
Games to share tech and work better together with less waste.

(#) Halo Studios

At Halo Studios I worked as a software engineer on the gameplay engineering
team. On the team I was able to lean on my game engine and systems development
experience to get my hands dirty on deep debugging, fixing architecture issues
with gameplay systems and reviving old previously-working systems such as co-op.

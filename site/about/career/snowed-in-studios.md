(#) Snowed In Studios

*October 2015 — December 2019*

At Snowed In Studios I worked as a senior software engineer, lead programmer and
technical director.

I joined the studio as employee #16 and helped grow the studio to over
100 employees. When I joined Snowed In Studios the company had just shipped
their independent title 
[Windforge](https://store.steampowered.com/app/266170/Windforge/) and was
focusing on projects for clients like PBS Kids and Eidos Montreal. Throughout
my time at Snowed In Studios the company focused more and more on co-development
until their eventual acquisition by the external development giant Keywords
Studios.

As I was often the engineering lead of multiple teams concurrently: the depth
of my contributions to projects varied widely. In some cases like Rokh and
Adventure Capitalist I was working almost entirely as an individual contributor
while managing other teams. In other cases like Elder Scrolls Blades I would
have no IC contributions and instead worked to help grow employees, improve
client relationships and help the studio foster a culture of engineering
excellence.

The projects I contributed to spanned web, mobile, PC and console. The majority
of projects (and longest running projects) would be for AAA game studios.
Examples of projects include: open world streaming tech, procedural world
generation, a visual script compiler, or an AI system to simulate NPC
interactions with oncoming traffic.

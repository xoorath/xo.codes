(##) For Honor

*October 2014 — September 2015*

I worked as a programmer on For Honor's UI team leading up to the E3 showcase
in 2015. In that time I worked mostly on the UI framework used by the team and
owned a few UI elements, screens, and experiences.

(##) Shape Up

*April 2014 — September 2014*

I was lucky enough to contribute to Shape Up for a short time leading up to
launch. Shape up is a fitness game for the Xbox One Kinect aiming to gameify
your workout. My contribution was to the initial experience where the player
is introduced to the game mechanics, controls and other important information.

(##) Watch Dogs

*April 2013 — April 2014*

 Working on Watch Dogs was a dream come true: my first foray into AAA game
 development. This role gave me an opportunity to work on and ship a title
 across Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4 and PC.

On Watch Dogs I worked on the UI team primarily optimizing the 3D aspects of
the UI for performance and memory. I also had a chance to contribute to some new
menus and hud elements. In particular I spent a lot of time working on the large
suite of 3D indicators that appear above characters, objects, objectives and
so-on.

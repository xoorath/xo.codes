I'm **xo** (*zz-oh*) (🏳️‍⚧️ *she/her*)

I grew up in Canada where I learned to make commercial video games. Today I live
in America's pacific northwest and make video games professionally.

I love tinkering and always have some number of projects on the go. I like
making small fast programs, making art and hosting events.

(#) Programming

I sure do spend a lot of time thinking about and developing software... It's
a very rewarding pastime for me and I'm privileged enough to do it
professionally - especially in such an artistic domain.

I often think about the ethics of software: Does this application waste
someone's time? Does it consume an unreasonable amount of energy for what
value it's offering? Is it considerate of other people's privacy? Is it
accessible?

The first programming language I learned was C++ and it's still one of the
languages I enjoy writing the most, probably because it's so familiar to me.

My favorite type of programming is the development of small applications that
are efficient, precise, and resilient. [ESD](github.com/xoorath/esd) is an
example of this sort of a project.

(#) What's in a name?

* xo is pronounced like zoe (*zz-oh* not *zz-oh-e*).
* xo is spelled with lowercase letters when possible (even at the start of a sentence).
* xo is a [mononym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym).
* Yes, a lot of systems
  [do not support my name properly](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/).
* xo is not a nickname. It's my real name and how you should refer to me unless
  you have my permission to do otherwise.
* My government name is not appropriate to use in non-government settings.

(#) Gender and pronouns

I'm proudly transgender and prefer she/her pronouns, and am okay with they/them
pronouns.

I will respect your pronouns and chosen name unless you demonstrate disrespect
for the pronouns and chosen names of others.

(##) Questions & conversations

Here is some shit people have asked me or said to me since transitioning and a
measured response to each. I hope you find it amusing or helpful.

**Does that mean you think you're a woman now?**

> My gender expression and identity are feminine and I would like to be referred
> to in the ways that our culture refers to women. You know what those ways are.
> I don't have a more narrowed down answer than that right now. I'm not sure 
> if I'm a transgender woman or a transgender person who prefers feminine
> expression and reception. I might be non-binary, gender non-conforming
> or something else.

**It sounds like there are some things you're still figuring out. Don't you
  think you should get some help figuring that out before making any big
  changes?**

> No, and now that you mention it: I'm actually under no obligation to have a
> concrete and unchanging gender identity or expression. I know what I want and
> how I feel. What I don't know is if the labels we're using in society today
> resonate with me perfectly. Maybe our society needs some help figuring things
> out before I'm expected to adopt it's labels?

**So is the end game you cutting your dick off?**

> What the fuck kind of question is that? For real... If I bring up my sexual
> health with you: we can talk about it then. Since&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't: you
> should really mind your Ps and Qs.

**I'm really struggling with your new name and pronouns - is it okay if I
call you by your [deadname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming) or the
pronouns I'm more used to?**

> No. Make an effort to show me respect if you expect me to treat you with
> respect. I'd really prefer we have a relationship based on respect and
> if we can't have that: we probably won't have much of one at all.

**What if I make a mistake and accidentally use your deadname or incorrect
pronouns? Will you be angry?**

> No, of course not. Even I've used my deadname before by accident as
> (embarrassing as that is). Change can be difficult to adapt to. What I'm
> asking you to do is make a respectful good faith attempt to treat me with
> respect, use my name (xo) and my preferred pronouns (she/her).

**I still don't get the whole they/them thing.**

> Ugh - yes you do... "*Your neighbor that lives alone: What was **their**
> name? What did you say to **them**?*" - it isn't that hard to refer to one
> person without making mention of **their** gender. You do it all the time.

**I'm going to stick with *a nickname based on your deadname* if that's cool.**

>  
> It isn't. Do not.

**Can I call you xoxo?**

>  
> Nono to xoxo :). That is cute but especially while I'm adapting to my chosen
> name I'd like it to be used.

**Are you going to legally change your name?**

>  
> Very unlikely - certainly not while living in America as an immigrant under
> a government that wants me scared, tortured, and dead, in that order bar none.

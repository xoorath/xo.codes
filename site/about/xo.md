Hey, I'm xo! Here are some fun things about my name.

- xo is my chosen name meaning I picked it for myself. It's not the name I was
  given by my parents shortly after I was born, and it also isn't a nickname. A
  chosen name is a real name: it's what you should call me.
- I chose xo because it's a name friends have been calling me online for many
  years. It's a short form of my name in online games: "xoorath". I liked that
  xo is a name that friends gave me!
- xo is pronounced like zz-oh, or the way some people pronounce the name Zoe.
- xo is a [mononym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym)! I may choose a last
  name in the future (maybe even the one I was given by my parents), but that
  would be just for practical reasons. As you might guess: quite a lot of forms
  and systems don't work well for anyone with atypical names. Sometimes you'll
  see my name on online accounts as "xo ." or "xo xo" for that reason. 
- xo is written in lowercase. When xo is the first word in a sentence: it's
  still proper to write it lowercase.
- I don't get offended by people messing up some of the proper uses of my name
  such as capitalization or appending my dead last name. People make mistakes
  and it's an atypical name: it's okay. Please just make an effort.

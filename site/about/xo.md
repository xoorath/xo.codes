I'm **xo** (*zz-oh*) (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è *she/her*)

I grew up in Canada where I learned to make commercial video games. Today I live
in America's pacific northwest and make video games professionally.

I love tinkering and always have some number of projects on the go. I like
making small fast programs, making art and hosting events.

# Programming

I sure do spend a lot of time thinking about and developing software... It's
a very rewarding pastime for me and I'm privileged enough to do it
professionally - especially in such an artistic domain.

I often think about the ethics of software: Does this application waste
someone's time? Does it consume an unreasonable amount of energy for what
value it's offering? Is it considerate of other people's privacy? Is it
accessible?

The first programming language I learned was C++ and it's still one of the
languages I enjoy writing the most, probably because it's so familiar to me.

My favorite type of programming is the development of small applications that
are efficient, precise, and resilient. [ESD](github.com/xoorath/esd) is an
example of this sort of a project.

# What's in a name?

Well Juliet, my name is xo. xo is a
[mononym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym) I chose when [transitioning
socially](https://transwhat.org/transition/socialtrans.html). It comes from the
shortened form of my online handle **xoorath** that friends sometimes shortened
to xo. I like that it came from my friends in a way!

Some quick info about my name:
* xo is pronounced like (*zz-oh*).
* xo is intentionally spelled with lowercase letters.
* xo is a [mononym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym) meaning I have no middle or last name.
* Yes, a lot of systems [do not support my name properly](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/).
* No, xo is not a nickname. It's my real name and how you should refer to me (unless you have my permission to do otherwise).
* My government name is not appropriate to use for me in non-government settings.


It's not offensive to me when people make mistakes. If you're struggling with
using a new name for me: it's okay so long as you're making an effort to treat
me with respect.

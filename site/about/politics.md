(#) Politics

![](/data/site/icons/no_nazi.svg width="60px")

This page is here to make it abundantly clear where I stand: I stand in
fierce opposition to racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia,
queerphobia, classism, xenophobia, colonialism and oppressive and coercive power
structures of all kinds.

I am committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and
white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and
its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and
ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary.
To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.

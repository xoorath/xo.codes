(#) Overview

I've worked primarily for AAA game companies as a generalist programmer with a
knack for low level c++ systems development. Even while working as a manager,
technical director, tech lead or similar: I've maintained a lot of involvement
in technical design and execution. I work best at a high level helping connect
the dots between engineering teams and studio-level operations and game
direction.

I love working with excited and empathetic creative people to make games that
challenge us and delight players. On every major project I endeavor to do my
life's best work and support others trying to do the same.

I'm **xo** (*zz-oh*) (*she/they*) 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏴‍☠️.

I grew up in Canada where I learned to make commercial video games. Today I live
in America's pacific northwest and make video games professionally.

I love tinkering and always have some number of projects on the go. I like
making small fast programs, making art and hosting events.
